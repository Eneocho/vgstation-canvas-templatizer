# /vg/station-canvas-templatizer
Turns the provided 32x32/24x24 image into a [jellyveggie canvas](https://jellyveggie2.github.io/jlvg2-gist/canvas/canvas.html) template
# Requirements
* Python (Works with v3.10.9, probably works with most other versions)
* Pillow package (pip install Pillow) 
# How to use
* Make 32x32 or 24x24 image.
* Save on the same folder as the templatizer.
* Open CMD on the folder.
* python templatizer.py image.png

It makes a txt file with a list of all hex colors first (for ease of use with hair spray or clown crayons), followed by the template.
